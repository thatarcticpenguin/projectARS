# AMBULANCE ROUTING SYSTEM
A react project built for predicting and selecting the best hospital taking into condsideration the number of beds, number of icu beds, and number of specialists available. Includes map and direction integration.

## 📌 Overview
In medical emergencies, every second saved translates to a life protected. Our project provides an energy-efficient digital infrastructure that allows hospitals to update their resource availability (beds, ICUs, specialists) in real-time. By utilizing Leaflet-based mapping, we ensure ambulances are routed to the most "ready" medical facility, minimizing transit time and fuel consumption.

## ✨ Core Features

- Views for both paramedics and hospital admin.
- Real-time updates to all dashboards and views from the cloud.
- Authentication for hospitals and users via Firebase.
- Map integration that shows all hospitals in the map.
- Shows directions and links to google maps
- Hospital dashboard: Can view patient details if sent and can edit bed/specialist availability.
- Paramedic enters details in the form, which is used to find and score nearby hospitals based on the below scoring formula
```
(beds/maxBeds)*0.35 + (icu/maxIcu)*0.30 + (specialists/maxSpec)*0.20 + (1/travelTime)*0.15
```
